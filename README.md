# C++ Console Application and Syntax Correction

This repository contains C++ source code for simple console applications, along with solutions to syntax correction exercises.

## Description

This repository was created to demonstrate basic C++ programming concepts and syntax correction skills. It includes the following:

* **PersonInformation.cpp:** A simple C++ console application that displays personal information for a fictional person.
* **CSC450_CT1_mod1-1.cpp:** A C++ program with syntax errors that have been corrected.
* **CSC450_CT1_mod1-2.cpp:** Another C++ program with syntax errors that have been corrected.

## Contents

* **PersonInformation.cpp:**
    * Displays the following information:
        * First Name
        * Last Name
        * Street Address
        * City
        * Zip Code
* **CSC450_CT1_mod1-1.cpp:**
    * Original file contained several syntax errors.
    * Corrected version compiles and displays a welcome message.
* **CSC450_CT1_mod1-2.cpp:**
    * Original file contained syntax errors.
    * Corrected version calculates and displays a monetary value.

## Notes

* The corrected files (CSC450\_CT1\_mod1-1.cpp and CSC450\_CT1\_mod1-2.cpp) address the syntax errors present in the original code, allowing them to compile and run successfully.
* The `conio.h` header and the `getch()` function are used for pausing the console output on some systems (like Windows).  This may not be portable to all platforms.
